Dynamic Cubemap Creator is a small tool in CS that allows you to create cubemap textures. Unlike ENB dynamic cubemaps, the ones in CS do not need to be black - they can contain information about tint and roughness of the material. For example for golden jewelry you would want a yellow tint and low roughness, which would give you clear yellow reflections. 

You can find the cubemap creator inside the Dynamic Cubemaps tab in CS menu. To enable the creator, you need to set the CREATOR keyword as a shader define and recompile your shaders (highlighted in the image below). Then you can set the tint and roughness however you want, and after hitting Export, the cubemap texture will appear in your MO2 overwrite folder.
